Useful tools for the paediatric endocrinologist

## What Is Included?

This if a Flutter project (v3.35.1) to create tools to be used by paediatric endocrinologists.

Mostly a work in progress but help is definitely welcome if people are interested.

Items to build currently are:

1. A glucose infusion rate calculator - this is something build elsewhere. I have a list of milks (standard and specialist) with their g/100ml so that it can include enteral and parenteral glucose.
2. Steroid calculator. This would offer standard hydrocortisone doses against a body surface area, sick day doses and iv emergency doses. It would also have a glucocorticoid converter.
3. Units converter - esp mU/L to pmol/L, ug/L to U/L, mg/dL to mmol/L, mmol/mol to %
4. Micropenis/Clitoral Length curve - normative values against age for children and neonates, for different ethnicities
5. Final Height predictors - currently support Bayley Pinneau, Tanner Whitehouse III, Roche Wainer Thissen

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository - you will need the Android and iOS SDKs installed, as well as Flutter ('>=3.4.1 <4.0.0') and Dart.

## Documentation

For the moment browse the [Wiki](https://github.com/eatyourpeas/endocrinologist/wiki) until there is a better place to put it. In particular there are details about the references and methodology used.

## Contributing

Please get involved! If you are a clinician, please post requests for new features, or bugs that you have found [here](https://github.com/eatyourpeas/endocrinologist/issues). This project is still not live and although there are unit tests, it has not been used 'in the wild'.
