Useful tools in your pocket for the paediatric endocrinologist

## Getting Started

This if a Flutter project to create tools to be used by paediatric endocrinologists.

Mostly a work in progress but help is definitely welcome if people are interested.

Items to build currently are:

1. A glucose infusion rate calculator - this is something build elsewhere. I have a list of milks (standard and specialist) with their g/100ml so that it can include enteral and parenteral glucose.
2. Steroid calculator. This would offer standard hydrocortisone doses against a body surface area, sick day doses and iv emergency doses. It would also have a glucocorticoid converter.
3. Units converter - esp mU/L to pmol/L, ug/L to U/L, mg/dL to mmol/L, mmol/mol to %
4. Micropenis curve - normative values against age
